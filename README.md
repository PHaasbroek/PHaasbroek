- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PHaasbroek
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Computational Fluid Dynamics, Simulations, and Fluid Mechanics. Therefore, anything that solves equations and draws pretty pictures from equations is within my interest. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to simulate a centrifugal pump (a common type of water pump) in order to find cavitation inception.
